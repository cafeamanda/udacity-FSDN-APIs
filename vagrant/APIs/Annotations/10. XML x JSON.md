# XML x JSON

So now that we've decided to go with a restful architecture for our development needs, what about the structure of our data? XML and JSON are two very viable options, so let's compare them side by side as well.

### XML
... was developed in 1997. It uses identifying tags similar to HTML and provides a rigid way of structuring data (identifying tags similar to HTML).

### JSON
... was developed in 2001 and is derived from the JavaScript language. Similar to HTML, it is easily human readable, but can be condensed with less characters to be very lightweight.

Once again, it seems like these specs aren't really helping in making a decision if one is better than the other. But since our APIs are made to best suit the developer, we should use a data structure that is most friendly to our end user.

Looking at data from **[programmableweb](https://programmableweb.com)**, we can see that XML started as the data structure of choice, but JSON has been quickly gaining ground year over year and is now the more popular data structure amongst new APIs. By piggy backing off the popularity of JavaScript, JSON has been readily accepted by the web development community as the most common way to structure data sent across restful APIs.

So for this course, it's JSON for the win!
