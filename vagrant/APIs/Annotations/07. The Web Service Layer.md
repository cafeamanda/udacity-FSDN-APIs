# The Web Service layer

The Web Service layer refers to the protocols that can sit on top of the application layer and can determine the format in which APIs are sent and received.

One of the most popular protocols at this level is the **Simple Object Access Protocol**, or **SOAP**. SOAP uses the Extensible Markup Language (XML) to transmit sets of information in the form of objects. SOAP most commonly sits atop the HTTP application protocol, but can also function with SMTP, or the Simple Male Transfer Protocol.

**REST**, a **Representational State Transfer**, is the up and coming alternative to SOAP.

> **Update:** While SOAP is still used in some contexts, RESTful APIs currently dominate the API landscape. It is no longer an 'up and coming' technology, but rather simply the best practice for API development.

**REST** is more a set of styles and guidelines than a protocol, since it leverages the features of HTTP in order to transmit information. HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, handle the management of a server's resources.
