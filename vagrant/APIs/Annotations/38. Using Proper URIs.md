# Using proper URIs

The URI, or Uniform Resource Identifier, is the path to find resources provided by your API. This means that our URI should always refer to resources and not to actions being performed on those resources.

##### example
**good URI:** `/tickets/4`
**not so good URI:** `/getTicketInfo/4`

And it's recommended to use the plural form for each resource name.

#### HTTP verbs

HTTP provides us with **8** verbs, or methods, we can use to indicate the desired method of action we want a server to take on an API endpoint. There's no rule forcing you to use all of these verbs, but it's a good practice to use them responsibly.

`HEAD` and `GET` requests can be called by search engines and web crawlers exploring the internet. Make sure these requests only provide information, but never modify your database or the state of your backend.

#### HTTP Statuses

HTTP also has status codes to indicate the different types of responses a server can send back to the clients. A good API should take advantage of these status codes for successful and erroneous HTTP responses.

Error messages you send to your users should be concise, clear, and informative. Proper URI paths, HTTP verbs and error messages are all important components for making your APIs understandable and easily implementable.
