# Make your own API Mashup

In this challenge, you will create your own API Mashup. Write a function called `findARestaurant` that will take in a string representation of a `mealType` and `location`.

This function should first geocode the location, and then pass in the latitude and longitude coordinates to the Foursquare API. After that, it should parse the JSON response, such that it returns the first restaurant in an easy to read format for the user. You'll have to explore the Foursquare documentation a little bit to figure out a way to retrieve an image of your restaurant if Foursquare has one. If no image is available, then provide a default image for the restaurant. The image should be sized to 300px by 300px.

Download the starter code for this exercise **[here](https://github.com/udacity/APIs/tree/master/Lesson_2/12_Make_Your_Own_Mashup/starter_code)**. I've added the following lines of code such that non-ascii characters, or characters not common to the English language, also render properly in your code:

```
import sys
import codecs
sys.stdout = codecs.getwriter('utf8')(sys.stdout)
sys.stderr = codecs.getwriter('utf8')(sys.stderr)
```

I also strongly recommend using the `browse` parameter when you send off your URI to Foursquare. This will search in a much wider vicinity than just the latitude/longitude coordinates you provide the API.

Your code should print the results to the terminal, when run from the command line. And also return a dictionary with the restaurant's name, address, and images.

This challenge is intended to be tough, but don't give up.

## Solution

Step one for the `findARestaurant` function was to geocode the location into latitude and longitude coordinates. Using the `getGeocodeLocation` function I previously created, I can simply call it here and store the coordinates in `latitute` and `longitude`:
```
def findARestaurant(mealType, location):
    latitute, longitude = getGeocodeLocation(location)
```

I can now build the URL to access the Foursquare API, passing in the necessary Foursquare `client_id`, `client_secret`, `latitute`, `longitude` and `mealType` to query the search:
```
    url = ('https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search?client_id=%s&client_secret=%s&v=20130815&ll=%s,%s&query=%s' % (foursquare_client_id, foursquare_client_secret, latitude, longitude, mealType))
```

I send off the request using the HTTP library, like I did with geocoding, and store the response in the result variable.
```
    h = httplib2.Http()
    result = json.loads(h.request(url,'GET')[1])
```

By exploring into the result object and then going into response and then venues, and finding the zeroth item, I found the first restaurant of my query to Foursquare, and then extracted information about that restaurant as well, here:
```
    if result['response']['venues']:
        #Grab the first restaurant
        restaurant = result['response']['venues'][0]
        venue_id = restaurant['id']
        restaurant_name = restaurant['name']
        restaurant_address = restaurant['location']['formattedAddress']
```
* I enclose this declaration inside an `if` statement to make sure at least one result was found.
* The `venue_id` will be necessary to find pictures taken in that particular restaurant.
* The name of the restaurant is always helpful, so we store that too.
* The address of the restaurant is a list that breaks up each part of the restaurant, such as the street, state, and country into a different entry. I want to make my address one long string, so I'm going to loop through the values and concatenate them into an address string, like so:
    ```
        address = ""
        for i in restaurant_address:
            address += i + " "
        restaurant_address = address
    ```
    Now it's separated by spaces and I update my `restaurant_address`.

Now I need to create another API request to the photos API in Foursquare in order to grab a photo from the restaurant. The `venue_id` gets passed in along with the `client_id` and `client_secret` in order to communicate with this API.
```
        #Get a 300x300 picture of the restaurant using the venue_id (you can change this by altering the 300x300 value in the URL or replacing it with 'original' to get the original picture)
        url = ('https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/%s/photos?client_id=%s&v=20150603&client_secret=%s' % (venue_id, foursquare_client_id, foursquare_client_secret))
        result = json.loads(h.request(url,'GET')[1])
```

Some results can contain multiple images, and other results can contain no images, so my code needs to account for that. If images are available, I can retrieve the first one by referencing the zero index value of this entry in my response:
```
        if result['response']['photos']['items']:
            firstpic = result['response']['photos']['items'][0]
            prefix = firstpic['prefix']
            suffix = firstpic['suffix']
            imageURL = prefix + "300x300" + suffix
```
* As stated in the foursquare documentation, this image contains a prefix and suffix string. Between the two substrings I can append dimensions for scaling the image, so I made it 300x300, and saved this as the `imageURL` variable.
* If no images were found, I will just use this stock photo of a cheeseburger in its place.
    ```
        else:
            imageURL = 'https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/12/21/23/56/hamburger-576419_1280.png'
    ```

I'm now going to create a dictionary that contains the restaurant `name`, `address`, and `image`, like so:
```
        restaurantInfo = {'name':restaurant_name, 'address':restaurant_address, 'image':imageURL}
        print "Restaurant Name: %s" % restaurantInfo['name']
        print "Restaurant Address: %s" % restaurantInfo['address']
        print "Image: %s \n" % restaurantInfo['image']
        return restaurantInfo
```
* I print these results so that they're in an easily readable format from the terminal, and also return the `restaurantInfo`.

Outside of my `if` statement, I can now handle the case that no restaurants were found. I'll just make a `print` statement saying *'No restaurants found'*, and return a string saying the same thing for now.
```
    else:
        print "No Restaurants Found for %s" % location
        return "No Restaurants Found"
```

Now, if I save and run my code, the find a restaurant method is called on several different mealTypes and locations, which I can see from my terminal.
