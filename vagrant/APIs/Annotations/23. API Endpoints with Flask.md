# API Endpoints with Flask

If you're familiar with the Flask web development framework, you should be no stranger to the `app.route` decorator. This decorator in Flask can be used to make URLs to render webpages and API Endpoits alike.

You should also import the `jsonify` package from Flask into your application. `jsonify` can convert dictionaries into JSON objects that can then be sent to the client. The `jsonify` function in Flask returns a flask response object that already has the appropriate content type header for use with JSON responses.

You will familiarize yourself with making basic API endpoints with Flask next.
