# Intro to Whats and Whys of APIs

Let's explore the design and implementation of web APIs!

Throughout this course, you'll work on several mini projects that each focus on a specific concept you will learn.

At the end of this course, you'll use all of the skills learned to create a final project called 'Meet and Eat': a social application for meeting people based on their food interests.

By building the back end of this application you will gain some insight into how these social applications work underneath the hood.

In addition you will learn some tips when it comes to designing API endpoints for client side consumption of your code.
