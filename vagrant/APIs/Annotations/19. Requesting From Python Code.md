# Requesting From Python Code

Using Postman and cURL were great tools for building our http requests. But let's create these requests and responses in Python so that we can embed those functionalities into our server-side code.

Let's start by writing a simple Python application that does the geolocation API requests for us. I'm going to name this Python program *geocode.py*. I will import the `httplib2` and `json` libraries into my program.

```
import httplib2
import json
```

`Httplib2` is a comprehensive http client library in Python, and the `json` library in Python is for converting in-memory Python objects to a serialized JSON representation.

Now, I will create a function and call it `getGeocodeLocation`. It'll take an input string that is the name for the place we want to get the coordinates for.

Then, I will create a variable for storing my `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. You should paste in your own key here.
```
def getGeocodeLocation(inputString):
    google_api_key = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

Having your secret keys visible in your Python code isn't the safest practice for live code, but it's fine for this activity.

Now, in my input string, I need to replace any spaces with plus signs, such that there are no breaks in my URL path, and the server can read it correctly, like so:
```
def getGeocodeLocation(inputString):
    google_api_key = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
    locationString = inputString.replace(" ", "+")
```

I then build the URL and pass in the location string and my Google API key:
```
    url = ('https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=%s&key=%s' % (locationString, google_api_key))
```

Next, I create an instance of the http class and name it `h`. I can now create a `GET` request with the `request` method, like so:
```
    response, content = h.request(url,'GET')
```

This request will return an array with two values: the http response and the content. I will call `json.loads` on the content to format it in a way that is easier to read, but still in proper JSON format.
```
    result = json.loads(content)
```

Now, just so we can see what the `response header` looks like, I will have it print to the terminal, and then I'll return the `result` variable, which contains the formatted content that I requested.
```
    print "response header: %s \n \n" % response
    return result
```

Now, let's save our code and start a Python instance in the terminal with `$ python`, in the same directory where my *geocode.py* file is.

```
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ python
Python 2.7.12 (default, Dec  4 2017, 14:50:18)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2

```
Let's import the `getGeocodeLocation` method from the geocode file, and we're trying to get the location of Dallas, TX.

```
>>> from geocode import getGeocodeLocation
>>> getGeocodeLocation("Dallas, Texas")
```

Here's what the terminal returns:
```
response header: {'status': '200', 'content-length': '1725', 'x-xss-protection': '1; mode=block', 'content-location': 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Dallas,+Texas&key=YOUR_KEY_HERE', 'expires': 'Wed, 19 Sep 2018 22:04:15 GMT', 'vary': 'Accept-Language', 'server': 'mafe', '-content-encoding': 'gzip', 'cache-control': 'public, max-age=86400', 'date': 'Tue, 18 Sep 2018 22:04:15 GMT', 'access-control-allow-origin': '*', 'alt-svc': 'quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="44,43,39,35"', 'content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8', 'x-frame-options': 'SAMEORIGIN'}

>>>
```

Here, we can see that our `response header` contains a successful status code along with a lot of other meta data that Google provided with our request.

Looking at the actual content of the response, we see that we got a lot more data than just latitude and longitude coordinates. But nevertheless, the information we requested is in the response somewhere.

Next, let's see if we can figure out a way to parse through all of this information in this response.
