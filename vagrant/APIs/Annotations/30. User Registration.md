# User Registration

So now that I have my User model in place, I will make a *views.py* file to handle the logic of actually registering a new user. I will structure this endpoint such that a client can register a new user with a POST request to `/users`.
```
@app.route('/users', methods=['POST'])
```
The body of this request needs to be a JSON object that has username and password fields. Let's take a look at the implementation of this flask route.
```
def new_user():
    username = request.json.get('username')
    password = request.json.get('password')
```
The username and password arguments are obtained from the JSON input coming from the request and then validated. If the arguments are valid, then a new user instance is created. The username is assigned to it and the password is hashed using the `hash_password` method. The user is then finally written to the database:
```
    if username is None or password is None:
        abort(400) # missing arguments
    if session.query(User).filter_by(username = username).first() is not None:
        abort(400) # existing user
    user = User(username = username)
    user.hash_password(password)
    session.add(user)
    session.commit()
    return jsonify({'username': user.username}), 201
```

The body of the response shows the user representation as a JSON object with the status code of `201`.

So let's run our application and try registering a new user with cURL, like so:
```
user:~$ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: applicatFFFFFF'
user:~$ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"Lorenzo","password":"Udacity"}' http://localhost:5000/users
```

My server responds that a new user has successfully been created:
```
HTTP/1.0 201 CREATED
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 27
Server: Werkzeug/0.10.1 Python/2.7.3
Date: Wed, 23 Sep 2015 06:39>41 GMT

{
    "username": "Lorenzo"
}user:~$
```

The *views.py* and *model.py* files are available **[here](https://github.com/udacity/APIs/tree/master/Lesson_4/03%20_User%20Registration)**.

It's also important to point out that in a real application, login should always be done over a secure HTTP connection. If the login credentials are going to travel through the networking clear text, they're easily visible to a potential hacker.
