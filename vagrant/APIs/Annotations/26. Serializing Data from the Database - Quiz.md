# Quiz - Serializing Data from the Database

Now that we have working endpoints, let's add a database to our application. Here's a **[new version of our web app](https://github.com/udacity/APIs/tree/master/Lesson_3/05_Serializing%20data%20from%20the%20database/Starter%20Code)** called *endpoints_project3.py*, along with a *models.py* file that contains our database configuration. The code has been refactored to use SQL Alchemy in order to execute actual CRUD operations on *puppies.db* file, instead of just returning print statements.

Your assignment is to add a serialized decorator to the database model in order to properly create JSON objects from the results of the database queries. Add the serialized property to your *models.py* file, and run the tester found **[here](https://github.com/udacity/APIs/tree/master/Lesson_3/05_Serializing%20data%20from%20the%20database/Starter%20Code)** to see if your serializer works properly.

## Solution

**models.py**
```
@property
def serialize(self):
    return {
        'name'          : self.name,
        'id'            : self.id,
        'description'   : self.description
    }
```
