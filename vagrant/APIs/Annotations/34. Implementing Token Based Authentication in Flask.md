# Implementing Token Based Authentication

There are several ways of implementing this functionality in your code, but this is one solution that I found to be rather easy to understand and secure. I have a new **[*models.py* file](https://github.com/udacity/APIs/tree/master/Lesson_4/07_Implementing%20Token-Based%20Authentication%20in%20Flask)** that contains the user model and the basic HTTP authorization code from the previous exercise.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column,Integer,String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from passlib.apps import custom_app_context as pwd_context
import random, string
from itsdangerous import(TimedJSONWebSignatureSerializer as Serializer, BadSignature, SignatureExpired)

Base = declarative_base()
secret_key = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits) for x in xrange(32))
```

On line 10, we have a secret key, which is just a random string of 32 characters that I will use to sign my tokens. I will also make a new method here called `generate_auth_token`:

```python
def generate_auth_token(self, expiration=600):
    s = Serializer(secret_key, expires_in = expiration)
    return s.dumps({'id': self.id})
```
* Here, I make the token be an encrypted version of a dictionary that hides the ID of the user. The token also has an expiration time embedded in it, which by default will be of 10 minutes, or 600 seconds.

The verification is implemented in a `verify_auth_token` static method:

```python
@staticmethod
    def verify_auth_token(token):
    	s = Serializer(secret_key)
    	try:
    		data = s.loads(token)
    	except SignatureExpired:
    		#Valid Token, but expired
    		return None
    	except BadSignature:
    		#Invalid Token
    		return None
    	user_id = data['id']
    	return user_id
```
A static method is used because the user will only be known once the token is decoded.

Now, in my *views.py* file, I'll make a new endpoint that the client can use to request a token:

```python
@app.route('/token')
@auth.login_required
def get_auth_token():
    token = g.user.generate_auth_token()
    return jsonify({'token': token.decode('ascii')})
```

Note that this endpoint is protected with the `auth.login_required` decorator from `flask_http` which requires that the username and password are provided.

Next, I'll add code for handling a token when my server receives one, with `verify_password`:
```python
@auth.verify_password
def verify_password(username_or_token, password):
    #Try to see if it's a token first
    user_id = User.verify_auth_token(username_or_token)
    if user_id:
        user = session.query(User).filter_by(id = user_id).one()
    else:
        user = session.query(User).filter_by(username = username_or_token).first()
        if not user or not user.verify_password(password):
            return False
    g.user = user
    return True
```
* The HTTP basic authentication protocol does not specifically require that usernames and passwords are used for authentication. These two fields in the HTTP header can be used to transport any type of authentication information. For token based authentication, the token can be sent as a username, and the password field can be ignored. This means that now the server can authenticate requests with the username and password **and** requests with just a token. The `verify_password` callback needs to support both authentication styles.

* This  new version of the `verify_password` callback attempts authentication twice. It first tries to use the username argument as a token. If that doesn't work, then username and password are verified as before.

I will run my web server again and send the following cURL request:

```powershell
curl -u Lorenzo:Udacity -i -X GET http://localhost:5000/token
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 139
Server: Werkzeug/0.10.1 Python/2.7.3
Date: Wed, 23 Sep 2015 13:26:30 GMT

{
    "token": "12390_Asudh2139diajad90+SUD0uw0eq0ue0-d_ASDOIJ19023849_saoidj0293409kds.0291390234dKA_jdqs93490d"
}
```

In order to get an authentication token, I will run my web server again, and send the following cURL request in order to get an authentication token.

```powershell
curl -u 12390_Asudh2139diajad90+SUD0uw0eq0ue0-d_ASDOIJ19023849_saoidj0293409kds.0291390234dKA_jdqs93490d:blank -i -X GET http://localhost:5000/protected-resource
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 31
Server: Werkzeug/0.10.1 Python/2.7.3
Date: Wed, 23 Sep 2015 13:31:17 GMT

{
    "data": "Hello, Lorenzo!"
}
```

Note that this last request, the password is written as the work `blank`. The password in this request can be anything, since it isn't used.
