# Versioning your API

Let's say we have and endpoint at `/puppies` that returns a collection of puppies with their date of birth in the form of month, date, and year, like `MM/DD/YYYY`. Later on, we realize that we can also include the information of the time of birth for each puppy, but we must change the format of the date of birth like so: `HH:MM:SS DD/MM/YYYY`. How do we add this feature without causing problems for users already using our endpoint?

Versioning allow you to make new functionalities without breaking features for users still using older implementations. If your application renders web pages and has API endpoints, specifying the API in your URI is also helpful for users:

```
GET /api/v1/puppies
GET /api/v2/puppies
```

## Versioning in your header
Another method of implementing versioning is by including the version number in your HTTP header. GitHub implements versioning this way.

Whichever method you choose, versioning is an important consideration for your users as your application grows and changes.
