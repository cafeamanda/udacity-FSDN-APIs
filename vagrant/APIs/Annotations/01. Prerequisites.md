# Prerequisites
In order to get the most out of this course, you should have a good grasp of Python programming. If you're comfortable making and using `functions`, `classes`, `dictionaries` and understand the basics of `properties`, `decorators` and `lambda` functions, you're in good shape for this course.

We will be using the Flask web development framework and SQLAlchemy extensively in this course. And understanding of OAuth2 flows will also be very helpful when it comes to securing your web API.

I highly recommend using a Vagrant environment for this course. Vagrant will allow you to work in a virtual machine with a shared folder you can access on your host computer. This way, if anything accidentally gets messed up in the vagrant machine, it won't affect your host machine. A link to downloading and installing a Vagrant machine, pre-installed with all the necessary libraries for this course, can be found <a href='#instructor-notes'>below</a>.

We will be delving into Google and Foursquare documentation, and playing with their APIs later in this course. You will need developer accounts for both of these applications, which can be created free of charge.
