# Quiz - Adding features to your Mashup

It's now time to put together everything you've learned thus far into a single mashed up web application. Let's leave the puppy application aside for a moment and go back to the restaurant menu application.

In this exercise, you will first have an endpoint that takes in a city name and meal type, geocodes the location, finds a nearby restaurant with that meal type, stores it in a database, and then returns a JSON object of that restaurant to the user. And this should happen on a POST request.
```
localhost:5000/restaurants?location=New+York+NY&mealType=spaghetti
```

On this same route, handle a GET request that returns all of the restaurants in your database, along with their name, ID number, Address and Image inside of a JSON object.
```
GET
localhost:5000/restaurants
{restaurant_name, id, restaurant_address, restaurant_image}
```

Then, you will make another endpoint that takes in a restaurant's id in the route.
```
localhost:5000/restaurants/<int:id>
```
A GET request to the route should return the name, ID number, address, and image of a specific restaurant.

An UPDATE along with any or all of the name, location and image parameters should update this restaurant information in your database.

And a DELETE to this route should remove this restaurant from your database.
