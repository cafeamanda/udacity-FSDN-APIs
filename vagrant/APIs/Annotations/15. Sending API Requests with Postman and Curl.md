# Sending API Requests with Postman and Curl

So your web browser does a great job of concealing a lot of the complexities of HTTP, such that the user can focus on the web surfing experience. But as developers, we need to be able to dig deep to see what is going on with requests and responses. Luckily there are several tools out there that we can use to generate HTTP requests and view responses. Let's discuss two of developers favorites.

## Curl

If you're a big fan of command line applications, Curl is one of the most popular command line tools for sending and receiving HTTP messages, even though it can also transmit on several other protocols.

Check out the official cURL **[documentation](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html)** and this **[blog post](http://www.ethanmick.com/getting-started-with-curl/)** for getting started with cURL.

## Postman

If you prefer a graphical user interface, Postman is an easy-to-navigate Chrome extension you can use to build and view HTTP messages.

Check out the **[Postman Documentation](https://www.getpostman.com/docs)** as well.

I recommend choosing one of these tools and getting familiar with it for future exercises.

You should also be familiar with **[query strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)** as option to pass in variables straight from the URI.
