# Quiz - Respond to Different Kinds of Requests

By default, the `app.route` decorator only responds to GET requests. Other requests like POST and DELETE must be specified inside the app.route using the Methods property, like so:
```
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
```

In this next exercise, add POST, PUT and DELETE methods for the appropriate endpoints in the new version of your *endpoints2.py* file. Run *endpoint_tester2.py* to check and see if these requests were successfully executed.

View the starter code **[here](https://github.com/udacity/APIs/tree/master/Lesson_3/04_Responding%20to%20Different%20Types%20of%20Requests/Starter%20Code)**.

## Solution

##### <p style='text-align: center'>endpoints2.py</p>
```
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)
# Create the appropriate app.route functions, test and see if they work, and paste your URIs in the boxes below.

#Make an app.route() decorator here
@app.route('/puppies', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def puppiesFunction():
    if request.method == 'GET':
      	#Call the method to Get all of the puppies
        return getAllPuppies()

    elif request.method == 'POST':
      	#Call the method to make a new puppy
        return makeANewPuppy()


#Make another app.route() decorator here that takes in an integer id in the
@app.route('/puppies/<int:id>', methods=['GET', 'PUT', 'DELETE'])
def puppiesFunctionId(id):
    if request.method == 'GET':
      	#Call the method to get a specific puppy based on their id
        return getPuppy(id)

    elif request.method == 'PUT':
  	     #Call the method to update a puppy
         return updatePuppy(id)

    elif request.method == 'DELETE':
  	     #Call the method to remove a puppy
         return deletePuppy(id)


def getAllPuppies():
  return "Getting All the puppies!"

def makeANewPuppy():
  return "Creating A New Puppy!"

def getPuppy(id):
	return "Getting Puppy with id %s" % id

def updatePuppy(id):
  return "Updating a Puppy with id %s" % id

def deletePuppy(id):
  return "Removing Puppy with id %s" % id

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.debug = True
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
```
