# Quiz - Making an Endpoint with Flask

Here's your **[starter code](https://github.com/udacity/APIs/tree/master/Lesson_3/03_Making%20an%20Endpoint%20with%20Flask/Starter%20Code)**.

#### endpoints.py
```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
# Create the appropriate app.route functions. Test and see if they work

#Make an app.route() decorator here for when the client sends the URI "/puppies"

def puppiesFunction():
  return "Yes, puppies!"


#Make another app.route() decorator here that takes in an integer named 'id' for when the client visits a URI like "/puppies/5"

def puppiesFunctionId(id):
  return "This method will act on the puppy with id %s" % id

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.debug = True
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

It contains code for starting a web application about puppies. This file already contains code for setting up a Flask web server but is lacking the appropriate `app.route` endpoints for some of the methods.

Create the appropriate `app.route` functions. Test and see if they work using the *endpoints_tester.py* file.

#### endpoints_tester.py
```
import httplib2
import json
import sys

print "Running Endpoint Tester....\n"
address = raw_input("Please enter the address of the server you want to access, \n If left blank the connection will be set to 'http://localhost:5000':   ")
if address == '':
	address = 'http://localhost:5000'
#Making a GET Request
print "Making a GET Request for /puppies..."
try:
	url = address + "/puppies"
	h = httplib2.Http()
	resp, result = h.request(url, 'GET')
	if resp['status'] != '200':
		raise Exception('Received an unsuccessful status code of %s' % resp['status'])
except Exception as err:
	print "Test 1 FAILED: Could not make GET Request to web server"
	print err.args
	sys.exit()
else:
	print "Test 1 PASS: Succesfully Made GET Request to /puppies"

#Making GET Requests to /puppies/id
print "Making GET requests to /puppies/id "
try:
	id = 1
	while id <= 10:
		url = address + "/puppies/%s" % id
		h = httplib2.Http()
		resp, result = h.request(url, 'GET')
		if resp['status'] != '200':
			raise Exception('Received an unsuccessful status code of %s' % resp['status'])
		id = id + 1

except Exception as err:
	print "Test 2 FAILED: Could not make GET Request to /puppies/id"
	print err.args
	sys.exit()
else:
	print "Test 2 PASS: Succesfully Made GET Request to /puppies/id"
	print "ALL TESTS PASSED!!"
```

Paste your URIs in the boxes below.

|Function|@app.route("_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _")|
|--------|--------|
|puppiesFunction()||
|puppiesFunction(id)|||

## Solution

```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
# Create the appropriate app.route functions. Test and see if they work

#Make an app.route() decorator here for when the client sends the URI "/puppies"
@app.route('/puppies')
def puppiesFunction():
  return "Yes, puppies!"


#Make another app.route() decorator here that takes in an integer named 'id' for when the client visits a URI like "/puppies/5"
@app.route('/puppies/<int:id>')
def puppiesFunctionId(id):
  return "This method will act on the puppy with id %s" % id

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.debug = True
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
```

|Function|@app.route("_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _")|
|--------|--------|
|puppiesFunction()|`/puppies`|
|puppiesFunction(id)|`/puppies/<int:id>`||
