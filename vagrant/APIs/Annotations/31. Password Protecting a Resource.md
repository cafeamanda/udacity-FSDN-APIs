# Password Protecting a Resource

Now that users can log in to my system, I should make a way to protect the resources they can access. For this example, let's assume there's a resource exposed by this API that needs to be available only to registered users. This resource is accessed at the end point `/protected_resource`.

To protect this resource, I'm going to use an extension of Flask called `flask_httpauth`. `flask_httpauth` is a simple extension that provides basic and digest http authentication for Flask routes.
```
from flask_httpauth import HTTPBasicAuth
auth = HTTPBasicAuth()
```

With `flask_httpauth`, an endpoint is protected by adding the `@auth.login_required` decorator to it, like so:
```
@app.route('/protected_resource')
@auth.login_required
def get_resource():
    return jsonify({'data': 'Hello, %s!' % g.user.username})
```

`flask_httpauth` needs to be given some more information to know how to validate user credentials, which is implemented through the `verify_password` callback.
```
@auth.verify_password
def verify_password(username, password):
    user = session.query(User).filter_by(username=username).first()
    if not user or not user.verify_password(password):
        return false
    g.user = user
    return True
```

It is given a username and password and returns `true` if the combination is valid and false if not.

`flask_httpauth` invokes this callback function whenever it needs to validate a username and password pair. This function simply finds the user by their username, verifies the password using the `verify_password` method and, if the credentials are valid, then the user is stored in Flask's `g` object, so that the `view` function can use it.

Let's send a request to our server now, and first see what happens if I use an incorrect username or password.
```
user:~$ curl -u Lorenzo:Yoodacity -i -X GET http://localhost:5000/protected_resource
HTTP/1.0 401 UNAUTHORIZED
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 19
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Authentication Required"
Server: Werkzeug/0.10.1 Python/2.7.3
Date: Wed, 23 Sep 2015 07:08:01 GMT

Unauthorized Accessuser:~$
```
I can't access the resource! But using the correct username and password, my request gets the protected resource for the user:
```
user:~$ curl -u Lorenzo:Udacity -i -X GET http://localhost:5000/protected_resource
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 31
Server: Werkzeug/0.10.1 Python/2.7.3

{
    "data": "Hello, Lorenzo!"
}
user:~$
```
